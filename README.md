## Project Overview

This repository contains a project designed to automate a routine task using Python.

The task involves taking a text that conains a bunch of MSISDNs in a specific format, manipulating the data within, and converting it to a `.csv` file. This `.csv` file is then processed by a `.sh` script on a Linux server to achieve the desired results.
